_How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?_ \
Agile user stories provide a standardized method to define user types, some functionality, and the reason for that functionality: As a (user type), I want (some functionality), so that (reason/outcome). User stories serve as a light-weight alternative to requirements in traditional waterfall software development. Unlike requirements, user stories are a collaborative effor for the Agile team and serve as increments of functionality.

_How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?_ \
As outlined above, user stories provide an increment of functionality in the Agile process. I believe the most important part of Agile is the iterative, incremental development process followed by a stage of reflection and improvement. These short cycles with feedback provide rapid improvement and development that are the hallmark of Agile.

_What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?_ \
I think a good team member in software development is someone who's willing to help her peers, communicates effectively, and lives up to her commitments.
